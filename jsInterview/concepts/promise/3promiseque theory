promise.all -([p1,p2,p3])-(3s,1s,2s)-if all of then is succes it will return you after 3s all of the promise [val1,val2,val3]
-it will wait for all api calls to finish
-but if any of them fails it will not move ahead then it will quickly returns the result
promise.allsetteled -([p1,p2,p3])-(3s,1s,2s)- in success case same as promise.all but in failure case it will still wait for all the api finished [val1,err,val2]
promise.race-([p1,p2,p3])-takes(3s,1s,2s)-it will retuen result of first settled prmise ans-val32
Promise.any-([p1,p2,p3]) -(3s,1s,2s)it will wait for first promise to be success ans=val2
if p2 gets rejected it will wait for p3 if p2 reject then wait for p1 (seeking 1st success)
first it will wait for sucees if all fails returns aggregated errs[eer1,err2,err3]
